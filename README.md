The exercises from Learning Go

This is where I've decided to keep code for the exercises from Learning Go by Jon Bodner. Not all of them will be here (as some involve simply other things), but I'll try to explain a few things where I see fit.

In addition, this is a good way of recognizing how Go packages/modules work. You'll note that each chapter is a Go file; originally, I was going to have each chapter be a folder with a Go file and a README before I realized that was causing issues with running main.go.
